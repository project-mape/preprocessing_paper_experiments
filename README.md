## Introduction

This repository contains the code and analyses related to the project MAPE, where we explore the hidden stories within almost 170,000 official correspondence documents spanning nearly 200 years of history. To extract the most valuable insights from this treasure trove of information, we utilize advanced natural language processing methods and named-entity recognition models to enrich our dataset. Join us on this exciting journey as we unlock the secrets of the past and shed new light on the history of the Portuguese empire in the Atlantic world.

More information is available at the project website: [projectmape.org](https://www.projectmape.org)
